<h1>Gender Specific Analyses </h1>

<h3>Gender Differences in ER Visits </h3>
<pThe US census reports that the population is 50.8% women. Women were more likely than men to visit the ER (54%) Using the central limit theorem, mu = 0.508, sd = sqrt(p*(1-p)/n), giving us a Zscore of 29-sigma. It's safe to say that this finding is significant based on our data. This finding has been independently corroborated by other <a href = "http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr090.pdf">studies</a> This difference is something that caught my interest and is worth exploring further.</p>

<h3>Insurance and Gender</h3>
<p>Percentage wise, approximately the same numbers of males and females were covered by private insurance. More women than men were covered by Medicare and Medicaid/CHIP, while more men than women were covered by Worker's Compensation or were paying out of pocket (Self-Pay)

<h3>Race/Ethnicity and Gender</h3>
<p>Across all races and ethnicities, women were more likely to use the ER than men were.

<h3>Chief Complaint and Gender</h3>
<p>Here we identified the 10 most commmon complaints for which patients went to the emergency room. The most common complaints for men and women both were stomach/abdominal pain and cramping, and chest-pain. What is most striking is that 2x as many women as men came to the ER when abdominal pain.
