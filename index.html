<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Emergency Rooms (ERs) fulfill an important healthcare role by providing services to patients in a wide-ranging variety of acute medical crises. Unfortunately, most models of healthcare economics view ERs as unprofitable, in some cases causing hospitals to curtail emergency services or even to eliminate the ER department entirely. In this project we would like to use the results of the <a href = "http://www.nber.org/data/national-hospital-ambulatory-medical-care-survey.html"> National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey </a> (NHAMCS) 2006 - 2011 data to look at the characteristics of patients who present to the ERs and the types of services they receive, as well as to identify any trends that may emerge. While the survey has been conducted since 1992, there have been significant changes to the data over time. To maintain consistency in analysis, we start with data from years 2007 through 2011 (as of April 2016, more recent data was not available).</p>
