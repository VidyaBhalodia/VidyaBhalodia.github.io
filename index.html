<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Emergency Rooms (ERs) fulfill an important healthcare role by providing services to patients in a wide-ranging variety of acute medical crises. Unfortunately, most models of healthcare economics view ERs as unprofitable, in some cases causing hospitals to curtail emergency services or even to eliminate the ER department entirely. In this project we would like to use the results of the <a href = "http://www.nber.org/data/national-hospital-ambulatory-medical-care-survey.html"> National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey </a> (NHAMCS) 2007 - 2011 data to look at the characteristics of patients who present to the ERs and the types of services they receive, as well as to identify any trends that may emerge. </p>

<p><b>Technical Details : </b> All data was imported into and analyzed through R. Due to changes in variables and variable descriptions, data from 2007-2011 was used for descriptive analytics and model building, while model testing was performed using data from 2006 </p>
