<h1>General Demographics</h1>
<p> First we took a look at our main variables of interest - Insurance, Age, Gender and Ethnicity. We will separate out each of our variables of interest by year, mainly to see if there are any obvious trends  combining them in future analyses is reasonable. Overall, we can see that there are no glaring differences over the 5 survey years that we are analyzing. In further analyses, we will pool data across years. </p>

<h3> Visit Volume by Year </h3>
<p> This is just a basic count of the number of ER visits reported by the survey in each of the years we are interested in. While it may seem that the number of ER visits surveyed dropped markedly in 2011 from 35k to 31k, overview of all the survey data in the series shows a high of 40k cases documented in 2003, to a low of ~21k in 1999.

<h3>Insurancy Type by Year</h3>
<p> Here we are looking at the distribution of the reported primary payers for each visit. The vast majority of patients have private insurance,  followed by Medicaid / CHIP, followed by Medicare. It is not indicated on this data whether any of the patients had multiple payers - which may cause some bias in the data

<h3>Gender and Age by Year</h3>
<p>Unsurprisingly, young children make up a large fraction of emergency room visits due to their susceptibility to illness and propensity for injury. What I find surprising is that there is such a dramatic difference in ER utilization in women vs men from ages 19 - 50.  The discrepancy in ER utilization in the oldest age ranges (>70) is probably due to the difference in longevity between men and women (more elderly women tend to use the ER than elderly men in this in part because women simply make up a significantly larger fraction of the population at those ages).

<h3>Race / Ethnicity by Year</h3>
<p>Unsurprisingly, young children make up a large fraction of emergency room visits due to their susceptibility to illness and propensity for injury. What I find surprising is that there is such a dramatic difference in ER utilization in women vs men from ages 19 - 50.  The discrepancy in ER utilization in the oldest age ranges (>70) is probably due to the difference in longevity between men and women (more elderly women tend to use the ER than elderly men in this in part because women simply make up a significantly larger fraction of the population at those ages).
